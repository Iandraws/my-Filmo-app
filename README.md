# Film App

Film App is a web application that allows users to search for and store information about films. It utilizes the OMDB API to fetch film data and provides a user-friendly interface built with Material-UI CSS. The entire application is developed using TypeScript to ensure type safety and enhance the developer experience.

## Features

- **Film Search**: Users can search for films using keywords or specific titles. The app fetches relevant film data from the OMDB API and displays the results.

- **Film Details**: Upon selecting a film from the search results, users can view detailed information about the film, including its title, release year, plot, cast, genre, and more.

- **Film Storage**: Registered users have the ability to save films to their personal collection. This feature allows them to easily access and manage their favorite films for future reference.

- **Material-UI CSS**: The user interface is designed using Material-UI CSS, providing a clean and modern look with responsive layouts, intuitive navigation, and interactive elements.

- **TypeScript**: The entire application is developed using TypeScript, a strongly-typed superset of JavaScript. TypeScript enhances code quality, provides better documentation, and enables a more robust development process by catching potential errors during compile-time.
